Doctors told Jullian that had his friend’s brain not swollen and had recovery been faster, he might well have survived.\n\nThe experience moved Jullian into action. He found out that most existing helmets use EPS foam inner linings to absorb the impact and that 87% of all deaths in accidents occur while wearing protective headgear. In other words, passive protective headgear is ineffective and he invented the Halo brain cooling helmet system.\n\n",
